Cyber Sprocket Labs provides online forums where you can post questions.  The
developers read the forums on a regular basis.   Most inquiries are responded

WordPress plugins are a fun way to share our work with the community, but it is 
not our main revenue stream.  Please be patient when looking for responses from 
our dev team.   We want everyone to enjoy using our products, but we must attend 
to the projects that pay the rent first.  Low cost plugins are fun, and we do 
want to support them but it can take a week or more to address any issues you
may be having.

modification we charge $120 for the work.

You can also suggest features or modificaitons in the forum.  We try to release
new features every few months and get most of our ideas from the forums.
